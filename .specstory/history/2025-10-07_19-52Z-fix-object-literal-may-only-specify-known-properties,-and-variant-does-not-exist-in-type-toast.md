# /fix Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'variant' does not exist in type 'Toast'. (2025-10-07 19:52Z)

/fix Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'variant' does not exist in type 'Toast'.

_**Assistant (copilot/gpt-4.1)**_

To fix the error, remove the unsupported 'variant' property from the toast object, as it is not defined in the 'Toast' type.
