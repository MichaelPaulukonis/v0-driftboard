_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

I'll check the memory database statistics for you. Here are your memory database statistics:

- **Total Memories**: 0
- **Unique Tags**: 0  
- **Database Size**: 3.72 MB
- **Database Path**: `/Users/michaelpaulukonis/Library/Application Support/mcp-memory/chroma_db`
- **Database Status**: Exists but appears empty
- **Last Updated**: Unknown

The memory database exists but doesn't contain any stored memories yet. The 3.72 MB size is likely from the initial database setup and structure files. You can start storing memories using the memory tools when you need to save information for later retrieval.
