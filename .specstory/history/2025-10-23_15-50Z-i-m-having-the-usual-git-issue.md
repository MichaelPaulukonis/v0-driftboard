# I'm having the usual git issue: (2025-10-23 15:50Z)

I'm having the usual git issue:

 git pull origin main
From https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/v0-driftboard
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint: 
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint: 
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.

I see you have divergent branches - your local main has commits that aren't on the remote, and the remote has commits that aren't on your local. Let me help you resolve this.

First, let me check the current git status to see what's going on: You have 1 local commit (`chore: specstory`) and the remote has 10 new commits from a merged pull request. Since your working tree is clean and you only have one local commit, I recommend rebasing to keep the history clean.

Let me rebase your local commit on top of the remote changes: There are merge conflicts in some `` files. Let me check what these conflicts look like:
