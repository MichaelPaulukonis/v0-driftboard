I need help creating a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new Driftboard feature. Guide me through this process by asking me targeted questions one section at a time. Wait for my response before moving to the next section.

We will create a detailed PRD/plan file that includes:

## 1. Executive Summary
- Brief overview of the feature
- Key value proposition

## 2. Problem Statement
- What problem does this solve?
- Current pain points and user frustrations

## 3. Product Vision & Goals
- Long-term vision for the feature
- Key objectives 

## 4. Target Users & Personas
- Primary user segments (me)
- User personas with demographics, goals, and pain points
- User journey mapping

## 5. Functional Requirements
- Core features (MVP)
- Advanced features (future releases)
- User stories with acceptance criteria

## 6. Technical Requirements
- Platform considerations
- Performance requirements
- Security and compliance needs
- Integration requirements

## 7. Design & UX Considerations
- Key design principles
- User experience goals
- Accessibility requirements

## 8 Timeline & Milestones
- Development phases
- Key deliverables
- Dependencies and risks

## 9. Assumptions & Constraints
- Key assumptions we're making
- technical constraints
- Risks and mitigation strategies

For each section, be specific and actionable. Include examples where helpful, and ask clarifying questions if you need more information about any aspect of the project. Save the file to `docs/plans/`.
