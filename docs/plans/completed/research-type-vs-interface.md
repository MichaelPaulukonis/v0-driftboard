# Research: `type` vs. `interface` in TypeScript

DONE: no action to be taken

**Description:**
Investigate the best practices and project conventions for using `type` aliases versus `interface` declarations for defining object shapes in TypeScript.

**Goal:**
Determine a consistent style to apply across the project for defining types to improve code clarity and maintainability.

**Key Questions:**
- What are the key differences between `type` and `interface`?
- When is one preferred over the other?
- What are the implications for extensibility (declaration merging)?
- What do the official TypeScript docs and community leaders recommend?
