# Export/Import Support for Formatted Text

## Overview

Support preservation of text formatting (URLs, markdown) in export and import operations.

## Context

During URL linking feature planning, identified need to maintain formatted text compatibility with existing export functionality and future import features.

## Scope

- Export formatted text while maintaining compatibility with current export system
- Future import functionality to preserve formatting
- Command-line scripts for export/import operations
- Support for URLs and potential markdown formatting

## Priority

Low - less important since import feature doesn't exist yet, and URL restoration after import is lower priority than core URL functionality
