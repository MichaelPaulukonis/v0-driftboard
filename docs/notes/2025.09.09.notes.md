## dog-food


I've been using it more. Finding issues with the UI, the default colors are AWFUL, and so much to be done. Which is the fun part!

Now .... can I _import_ from Trello?

There's no feature parity, so we'd be throwing away a lot of data.....

`/Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/v0-driftboard/docs/notes/WdA1q4uV - polychrometext.json` - is PolychromeText exported from Trello.


Thinking about what I'm doing and how I'm using it, I should probably keep Consulting work on Trello, and personl work (like Driftboard/PCT) in Driftboard.
