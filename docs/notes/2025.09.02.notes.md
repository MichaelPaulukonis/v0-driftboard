# random things

## dog-food

I'm using the app for a few things. It seems stable enough, and using it gives me a better sense of what I want/need/expect.

But I'm going to need stability - so there should be an import/export mechanism - or other form of backup.

DONE - we can export, kinda. So there's that.

I've been using it more. Finding issues with the UI, the default colors are AWFUL, and so much to be done. Which is the fun part!

Now .... can I _import_ from Trello?

There's no feature parity, so we'd be throwing away a lot of data.....
