# Task ID: 45
# Title: Analyze and refactor CardDetailDialog component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Analyze the existing CardDetailDialog component structure and prepare it for inline editing capabilities
# Details:
1. Review the current implementation of `components/card-detail-dialog.tsx`
2. Identify areas where title and description are rendered
3. Refactor the component to support state management for editing mode
4. Create state variables for tracking edit modes (isEditingTitle, isEditingDescription)
5. Ensure the component structure can accommodate the new UI elements
6. Extract reusable logic from `components/edit-card-dialog.tsx` that can be used for inline editing
7. Set up proper TypeScript interfaces for the component props and state
8. Ensure accessibility is maintained throughout the refactoring

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests to verify the component renders correctly in both view and edit modes
2. Test that state transitions work as expected when toggling between modes
3. Verify that the component maintains all existing functionality
4. Use React Testing Library to test component rendering and state management
