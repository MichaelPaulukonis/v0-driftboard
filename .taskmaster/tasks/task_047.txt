# Task ID: 47
# Title: Implement inline description editing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 45
# Priority: high
# Description: Allow users to edit the card description directly within the card detail dialog with dedicated save and cancel buttons
# Details:
1. Modify the description display in `components/card-detail-dialog.tsx` to be clickable
2. Implement a state toggle when the description is clicked to switch to edit mode
3. Replace the description display with a textarea when in edit mode
4. Add 'Save' and 'Cancel' buttons below the textarea
5. Implement handlers for the save and cancel actions
6. Reuse the card update logic from the existing codebase
7. Implement optimistic UI updates for a responsive feel
8. Add visual feedback during the saving process
9. Handle potential errors during save operations
10. Ensure the textarea is properly styled and supports auto-resizing based on content
11. Maintain markdown support if the current description supports it

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the description edit functionality using React Testing Library
2. Test all edge cases: empty descriptions, very long descriptions, markdown content
3. Test the Save and Cancel button functionality
4. Mock the Firebase service and verify it's called with correct parameters
5. Test error handling scenarios
6. Verify the UI updates optimistically before the backend confirms the change
7. Test that the textarea properly resizes with content
