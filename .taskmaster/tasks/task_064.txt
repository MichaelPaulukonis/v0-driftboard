# Task ID: 64
# Title: Add Double-Click Shortcut to Edit List Title
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a shortcut to allow users to edit a list's title by double-clicking it. This improves user experience by providing a faster way to rename lists. The `Escape` key should cancel the edit.
# Details:
In `components/list-column.tsx`, add an `onDoubleClick` handler to the list title element. This handler should set the component into its 'isEditing' state. The existing `handleCancelEdit` function, which is triggered by `Escape`, will handle cancellation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Go to a board view.
2. Double-click on a list's title.
3. Verify that the title turns into an input field.
4. Press `Escape` and verify the edit is cancelled.
5. Double-click again, change the name, and press `Enter`. Verify the list title is updated.
