# Task ID: 67
# Title: Implement Draggable Reordering for Boards
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Allow users to reorder their boards on the main dashboard using drag-and-drop. Note: Exploring alternative organization methods beyond simple drag-and-drop reordering.
# Details:
Using the existing `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` library, implement the necessary draggable and drop-target adapters for the board cards on the dashboard. The `onDrop` handler will need to call a new `boardService` function to persist the new order in Firestore.

Alternative organization methods to consider:
1. Multi-board 'workspaces' - Allow users to group related boards into workspaces for better organization
2. 'Starred boards' feature - Enable users to mark favorite boards for quick access
3. Tagging/categorization system - Let users apply tags to boards for filtering and organization

# Test Strategy:
If implemented, test both the drag-and-drop functionality and any alternative organization methods selected.
