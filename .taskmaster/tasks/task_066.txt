# Task ID: 66
# Title: Implement Draggable Reordering for Lists
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 73
# Priority: low
# Description: Allow users to reorder lists horizontally on the board page using drag-and-drop.
# Details:
Using the existing `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` library, implement the necessary draggable and drop-target adapters for the list columns. The implementation will follow the new architecture of using separate, dedicated elements for different drag-and-drop interactions within the ListColumn component. The `onDrop` handler will need to call a new `listService` function to persist the new order in Firestore. This work will begin after the card-dragging regression is fixed.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test that lists can be dragged and reordered horizontally
2. Verify that the new order is correctly persisted in Firestore
3. Test edge cases like dragging the first list to the end and vice versa
4. Ensure the UI updates immediately to reflect the new order before the backend sync completes
