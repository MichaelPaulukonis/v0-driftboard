# Task ID: 52
# Title: Implement concurrent editing notifications
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 46, 47, 48, 49
# Priority: low
# Description: Add notifications to inform users when another user has made changes to the card they are viewing
# Details:
1. Implement a mechanism to detect when a card has been modified by another user
2. This could use Firestore's real-time capabilities to listen for document changes
3. When a change is detected while a user is viewing a card:
   - Show a non-intrusive notification (toast or banner)
   - Inform the user that the card has been updated
   - Offer an option to refresh the view with the latest data
4. Implement the refresh functionality to update the card data
5. Ensure the notification is dismissible
6. Handle edge cases such as multiple rapid updates
7. Consider implementing a cooldown period for notifications to prevent spam
8. This is a 'nice-to-have' feature as specified in the PRD

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the change detection mechanism using mock Firestore events
2. Verify that notifications appear correctly when changes are detected
3. Test the refresh functionality to ensure it updates the card data
4. Test edge cases like multiple rapid updates
5. Verify that notifications are dismissible
6. Test the integration with Firestore's real-time capabilities
