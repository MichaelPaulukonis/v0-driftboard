# Task ID: 50
# Title: Implement offline editing support
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 46, 47, 48, 49
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable users to edit cards while offline with appropriate caching and synchronization when connection is restored
# Details:
1. Implement a connection status detector using browser APIs (navigator.onLine and related events)
2. Create a local cache mechanism for storing edits made while offline
3. When a user attempts to save changes while offline:
   - Store the changes in local storage or IndexedDB
   - Show a visual indicator that the changes are pending sync
   - Add the change to a queue of pending operations
4. When the connection is restored:
   - Detect the online status change
   - Process the queue of pending operations
   - Update the UI as operations succeed or fail
   - Show appropriate notifications to the user
5. Handle conflict resolution using a 'last-write-wins' strategy as specified in the PRD
6. Implement appropriate error handling for failed synchronizations
7. Consider using a library like Workbox for offline support if appropriate

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the connection status detection mechanism
2. Test the local caching of edits while offline
3. Test the synchronization process when connection is restored
4. Simulate various network conditions to verify robustness
5. Test conflict resolution scenarios
6. Verify that appropriate notifications are shown to the user
7. Test that the UI correctly reflects the sync status of changes
