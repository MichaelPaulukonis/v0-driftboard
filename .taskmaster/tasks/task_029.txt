# Task ID: 29
# Title: Update Card Description Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 27
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the URL detection utility with the card description component to render clickable links
# Details:
Modify the `CardItem.tsx` component to use the linkifyText utility:

1. Import the linkifyText function:
```typescript
import { linkifyText } from '../lib/utils';
```

2. Update the card description rendering to use the linkifyText function:
```typescript
// Before:
<p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">{card.description}</p>

// After:
<p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">{linkifyText(card.description)}</p>
```

3. Ensure the component correctly handles empty descriptions

4. Verify that the styling of links integrates well with the existing card styling

5. Test that links are clickable and open in new tabs

6. Confirm that the plain text storage format is maintained when saving card descriptions

# Test Strategy:
Create component tests using React Testing Library to:
1. Verify links are correctly rendered in card descriptions
2. Test that clicking links opens them in new tabs
3. Confirm that non-URL text renders normally
4. Test with various description content including multiple links
5. Verify that editing and saving descriptions maintains the plain text format
