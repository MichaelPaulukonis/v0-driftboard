# Task ID: 62
# Title: Add Ctrl/Cmd+Enter Shortcut to Description Fields in Dialogs
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: In several dialogs, the `description` Textarea does not submit the form on `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`. This is inconsistent with other parts of the application. This task is to add this keyboard shortcut to the description Textarea in the identified components.
# Details:
Update the following files:
- `components/create-board-dialog.tsx`
- `components/create-card-dialog.tsx`
- `components/edit-board-dialog.tsx`
- `components/edit-card-dialog.tsx`

For each file, add an `onKeyDown` handler to the description `Textarea`. The handler should check for `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` and, if detected, it should programmatically submit the form.

# Test Strategy:
For each of the four dialogs: 
1. Open the dialog. 
2. Fill in the title. 
3. Type a description. 
4. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` while focused on the description field. 
5. Verify that the form is submitted successfully.
