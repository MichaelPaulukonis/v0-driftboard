# Task ID: 34
# Title: Document URL Linking Feature
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33
# Priority: low
# Description: Create documentation for the URL linking feature including implementation details and usage guidelines
# Details:
Create comprehensive documentation for the URL linking feature:

1. Update the project README.md with information about the new feature:
```markdown
## URL Linking

DriftBoard now supports automatic URL detection and linking in card descriptions and comments. URLs are automatically converted to clickable links that open in new tabs.

Supported URL formats:
- Standard http/https URLs (e.g., https://example.com)
- URLs starting with www (e.g., www.example.com)
- Localhost URLs with port numbers (e.g., localhost:3000)

This feature makes it easier to reference external resources, documentation, and related items without breaking your workflow.
```

2. Add code documentation for the linkifyText utility function:
```typescript
/**
 * Converts URLs in text to clickable links
 * 
 * @param text - The input text that may contain URLs
 * @returns React nodes with URLs converted to anchor tags
 * 
 * Supported URL formats:
 * - http/https protocols (e.g., https://example.com)
 * - www patterns without protocol (e.g., www.example.com)
 * - localhost URLs with port numbers (e.g., localhost:3000)
 */
export function linkifyText(text: string): React.ReactNode {
  // Implementation
}
```

3. Create developer documentation explaining:
   - How the feature works
   - How to use it in new components
   - Testing considerations
   - Known limitations

4. Update any user-facing documentation to explain the new feature

# Test Strategy:
1. Review documentation for accuracy and completeness
2. Verify code examples in documentation work correctly
3. Have another team member review the documentation
4. Test following the documentation to implement the feature in a new component
5. Verify user-facing documentation clearly explains the feature
