# Task ID: 61
# Title: Audit Data-Entry Fields for Keyboard Shortcut Consistency
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Review all input fields, textareas, and forms in the application. Ensure that `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` is consistently used for submission and `Escape` is used for cancellation of an edit. This audit should cover all dialogs and inline editing components.
# Details:
- Identify all components with data entry fields (e.g., `create-board-dialog`, `create-list-dialog`, `create-card-dialog`, `edit-board-dialog`, etc.).
- For each component, check the behavior of `Enter`, `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`, and `Escape`.
- Create a list of components that are inconsistent.
- For each inconsistency, create a new task with details on how to fix it.

# Test Strategy:
Manual testing across all forms and editable fields in the application. Create a checklist of components to review.
