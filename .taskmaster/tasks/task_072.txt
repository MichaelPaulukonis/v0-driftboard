# Task ID: 72
# Title: Improve Card Drag-and-Drop UX with Placeholder
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 73
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the card drag-and-drop interaction to use a full-size placeholder (a 'ghost' card) instead of a simple drop indicator line. This will make the drop target clearer and prevent the list from resizing during reordering, creating a more stable and intuitive user experience.
# Details:
1. Modify the drag-and-drop logic for cards, likely in `list-column.tsx` and `card-item.tsx`.
2. Instead of rendering a `<DropIndicator />`, render a placeholder component (`CardSkeleton` or a new `CardPlaceholder`) that has the same dimensions as the card being dragged.
3. The placeholder should appear in the list at the potential drop position.
4. Ensure the list's size does not change while reordering a card within it.
