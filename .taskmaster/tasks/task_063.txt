# Task ID: 63
# Title: Automate App Version Bumping and Display in UI
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a process to automatically increment the application version in `package.json` upon release. Also, make the current app version visible somewhere in the UI, like the footer or a settings page, for easier debugging and user reference.
# Details:
- Investigate tools for automating version bumps (e.g., `npm version`, `standard-version`).
- Integrate the chosen tool into the release workflow (e.g., as a git hook or a release script).
- Expose the version from `package.json` to the Next.js frontend (e.g., via build-time environment variables).
- Add a small UI element to display the application version.

# Test Strategy:
- Verify that the version bump script correctly increments the version in `package.json`.
- Confirm that the new version is visible in the UI after a build.
