# Task ID: 48
# Title: Add Archive and Delete action buttons
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 45
# Priority: high
# Description: Add Archive and Delete buttons to the card detail dialog and implement their functionality
# Details:
1. Design and add Archive and Delete buttons to the card detail dialog
2. Position the buttons appropriately in the UI (likely in a footer or header area)
3. Implement click handlers for both actions
4. For Archive:
   - Call the appropriate function from `lib/firebase-service.ts`
   - Close the dialog after successful archiving
   - Update the board UI to remove the archived card
5. For Delete:
   - Implement a confirmation dialog using a modal or toast
   - Only proceed with deletion after user confirmation
   - Call the appropriate function from `lib/firebase-service.ts`
   - Close the dialog after successful deletion
   - Update the board UI to remove the deleted card
6. Add appropriate visual styling and hover states for the buttons
7. Include proper icons for each action

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the presence and styling of the action buttons
2. Test the click handlers for both buttons
3. For Delete, test that the confirmation dialog appears and works correctly
4. Mock the Firebase service and verify it's called with correct parameters
5. Test that the dialog closes after successful operations
6. Verify the board UI updates correctly after operations
7. Test error handling scenarios
