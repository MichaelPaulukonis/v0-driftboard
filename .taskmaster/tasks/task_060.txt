# Task ID: 60
# Title: Add Escape Key Handling to Card Description Editing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: In `components/card-detail-dialog.tsx`, the description `Textarea` does not handle the `Escape` key to cancel editing. This is inconsistent with the title editing. This task is to add an `onKeyDown` handler to the description `Textarea` to cancel the edit on `Escape`.
# Details:
- In `components/card-detail-dialog.tsx`, locate the `Textarea` for the description.
- Add an `onKeyDown` handler.
- Inside the handler, check for the `Escape` key.
- If `Escape` is pressed, call `setIsEditingDescription(false)` and reset the `description` state to `card.description || ''`.
- It may be necessary to call `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent the dialog from closing.

# Test Strategy:
Manual testing: 
1. Open a card and click to edit the description. 
2. Type something. 
3. Press `Escape`. 
4. Verify that the edit mode is cancelled, the changes are discarded, and the dialog is still open.
