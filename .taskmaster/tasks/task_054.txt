# Task ID: 54
# Title: Conduct comprehensive testing and performance optimization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform thorough testing of all implemented features and optimize performance to meet the sub-500ms response requirement
# Details:
1. Create a comprehensive test plan covering all implemented features
2. Implement end-to-end tests using Cypress or a similar tool
3. Conduct performance testing to ensure all operations complete within 500ms as specified in the PRD
4. Optimize component rendering using React best practices:
   - Memoization with useMemo and useCallback
   - Proper use of React.memo for component memoization
   - Efficient state management
5. Implement performance monitoring to track response times
6. Optimize Firebase queries and updates
7. Implement loading states and skeletons for operations that might take time
8. Test on various devices and network conditions
9. Address any accessibility issues identified during testing
10. Document any performance optimizations for future reference

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the comprehensive test suite covering all features
2. Conduct performance testing using browser dev tools and custom timing measurements
3. Test on various devices and network conditions including throttled connections
4. Use Lighthouse or similar tools to assess performance metrics
5. Verify that all operations meet the sub-500ms requirement specified in the PRD
6. Test accessibility using automated tools and manual testing
