# Description: Integrate the URL detection utility with the comment component to render clickable links in comment content
# Details:
Modify the `CommentItem.tsx` component to use the linkifyText utility:

1. Import the linkifyText function:
```typescript
import { linkifyText } from '../lib/utils';
```

2. Update the comment content rendering to use the linkifyText function:
```typescript
// Before:
<p className="text-gray-600">{comment.content}</p>

// After:
<p className="text-gray-600">{linkifyText(comment.content)}</p>
```

3. Ensure the component correctly handles empty comments

4. Verify that the styling of links integrates well with the existing comment styling

5. Test that links are clickable and open in new tabs

6. Confirm that the plain text storage format is maintained when saving comments

# Test Strategy:
Create component tests using React Testing Library to:
1. Verify links are correctly rendered in comments
2. Test that clicking links opens them in new tabs
3. Confirm that non-URL text renders normally
4. Test with various comment content including multiple links
5. Verify that adding new comments with URLs works correctly
6. Test that the plain text format is maintained in the database
