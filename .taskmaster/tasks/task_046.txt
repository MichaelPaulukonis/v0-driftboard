# Task ID: 46
# Title: Implement inline title editing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 45
# Priority: high
# Description: Enable users to edit the card title directly within the card detail dialog by clicking on it
# Details:
1. Modify the title display in `components/card-detail-dialog.tsx` to be clickable
2. Implement a state toggle when the title is clicked to switch to edit mode
3. Replace the title display with an input field when in edit mode
4. Add event handlers for:
   - Save on Enter key press
   - Cancel on Escape key press
   - Save on blur (clicking away)
5. Reuse the card update logic from the existing codebase
6. Implement optimistic UI updates for a responsive feel
7. Add visual feedback during the saving process
8. Handle potential errors during save operations
9. Ensure the input field is properly styled to match the design system

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the title edit functionality using React Testing Library
2. Test all edge cases: empty titles, very long titles, special characters
3. Test keyboard interactions (Enter to save, Escape to cancel)
4. Test blur behavior
5. Mock the Firebase service and verify it's called with correct parameters
6. Test error handling scenarios
7. Verify the UI updates optimistically before the backend confirms the change
