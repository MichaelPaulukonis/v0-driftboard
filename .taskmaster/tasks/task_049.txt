# Task ID: 49
# Title: Implement Mark as Done functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 45, 48
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add a Mark as Done button to the card detail dialog to allow users to quickly change a card's status
# Details:
1. Design and add a Mark as Done button to the card detail dialog
2. Position the button appropriately in the UI
3. Implement a click handler for the action
4. Determine the current status of the card and toggle it appropriately
5. Call the appropriate function from `lib/firebase-service.ts` to update the card status
6. Implement optimistic UI updates for a responsive feel
7. Add visual feedback during the saving process
8. Handle potential errors during save operations
9. Consider making this a toggle button that shows different text based on current status (e.g., 'Mark as Done' vs 'Mark as To Do')
10. Add appropriate visual styling and hover states for the button

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the presence and styling of the Mark as Done button
2. Test the click handler functionality
3. Test that the button text/appearance changes based on the card's current status
4. Mock the Firebase service and verify it's called with correct parameters
5. Verify the UI updates optimistically before the backend confirms the change
6. Test error handling scenarios
