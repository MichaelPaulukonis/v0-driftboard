# Task ID: 32
# Title: Verify Export Functionality Compatibility
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 29, 30
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure that the URL linking feature doesn't break the existing export functionality
# Details:
Test and verify that the export functionality works correctly with the new URL linking feature:

1. Review the current export implementation to understand how card descriptions and comments are processed

2. Verify that the linkifyText function is only used for rendering and doesn't affect the stored text format

3. Create test cases with various URL patterns in card descriptions and comments

4. Test the export functionality with these test cases

5. Verify that exported data contains the original plain text with URLs (not HTML)

6. If any issues are found, modify the export function to ensure it uses the raw text data rather than the rendered HTML

Example verification approach:
```typescript
// Ensure export function uses raw text data
export function exportBoard(board) {
  return {
    ...board,
    cards: board.cards.map(card => ({
      ...card,
      // Use the raw description, not the rendered HTML
      description: card.description,
      comments: card.comments.map(comment => ({
        ...comment,
        // Use the raw content, not the rendered HTML
        content: comment.content
      }))
    }))
  };
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create integration tests that verify export functionality with URLs in content
2. Test exporting boards with various URL patterns in descriptions and comments
3. Verify that exported data contains the original plain text URLs
4. Test importing exported data to ensure round-trip integrity
5. Manually test the export feature with real-world examples
6. Verify that exported data can be correctly imported into other systems if applicable
